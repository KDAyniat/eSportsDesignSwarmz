        <h1 style="text-align:center;">eSports Design Swarm Designer and Client Rules</h1>
        <div>
            <div>

            <div>
                <h2>eSports Design Swarm Submission Rules</h2>
                <p>eSports Design Swarm&apos;s rules outline the requirements for participating in All contests. As a designer, you must follow these rules in order to be eligible to receive payment for your contest wins.</p>

                <h3>Ethic and Attitude</h3>
                <p>Always treat everyone with respect and kindness. Do not attack another designer anywhere on the site and/or in conversation with a client.
                    Do not point out another designers failures to follow the rules unless you are contacting support. Always report your issues to us and the staff here will investigate your claims. Only report a designer or client once and wait for our response.
                    Multiple or repetitive reporting of a designer or client can get you banned temporarily or permanently. One designer cannot create multiple profiles and submit work to the same contest. One profile Only per contest per member (person).
                    If your organization consists of more than one designer each designer Must create a unique profile. If your organization wants to have one profile that is used for all your designers please contact us via info@esportsdesignswarm.com.
                    The staff here at eSports Design Swarm are here to provide a care free experience that delivers high quality designs and posts high quality contests for the designers to enter, don&apos;t make our job any harder than it is already.</p>

                <h3>Only submit original designs</h3>
                <p>All designers must submit your own work/designs. Do not copy/steal another design. Never use stock images, clip-art or purchased vectors in a logo design. Use of stock images in any other contest must be declared to the client when submitting any entry to a contest.
                    Do not accept instructions from clients if those instructions ask you to violate esportsdesignswarm.com User Agreement, Privacy Clause, or Rules for either entering or posting contest(s) and/or violate another person&apos;s intellectual property rights (such as a request that you copy/steal the elements of a design submitted by another designer).
                    eSports Design Swarm does not protect unoriginal ideas, even if they are submitted first in a contest. Example, in a contest for logo design that asks for a tiger design, we won’t protect design elements using tigers – the name itself suggests that such elements are appropriate.
                    All rights to all designs you create belong to you (the designer) unless your design is chosen as winner. Once the designer has received payment you Must deliver All necessary files, including the original layered file the design is created in, without haste and without delay. Any designer that refuses to deliver winning design files after the payment has been issued will be permanently banned from the site. esportsdesignswarm.com will view case by case delays in the designer delivering the final files to the paying client.
                    Once the payment has been received ALL RIGHTS to the winning design are passed onto the paying client. The designer no longer retains Any rights to winning design. If your design is not chosen as a winner, then the designer (you) retain All Rights to Any design submitted in Any Contest(s).
                    We will NEVER allow any contest to be completed if there is a pending claim of non-compliance with our rules, final delivery of design file(s), and/or an intellectual property violation. After 5 days have passed and the client has not selected a winner (and the client has not asked for an extension regarding choosing a winner) esportsdesignswarm.com will automatically close the contest and refund the client.
                    Incomplete contest (contest that never have a winner chosen) go against the paying client&apos;s profile and leave a permanent mark on their profile. The more you see a clients rating effected by incomplete contests the less likely the client will receive entries for their contest(s). We do this as a way to help inform our designers of sketchy clients. The same is done with designers ratings on their profiles, which enables the client to see the what kind of designer they may potentially work with or award their contest prize money.
                    If you are busted for using stock images without revealing this to the buyer or copying designs your account will be put on probation (temporarily banned from site), a 2nd offense and you will be permanently banned. We will NEVER allow any contest to be completed if there is a pending claim of an intellectual property violation. 
                    Delivery of final design to client
                    Final design files must be delivered in the appropriate format for the client&apos;s desired purpose/use, including the original layered file the design was created in with all unnecessary layers deleted. All logo designs must be delivered in the original layered file with all unnecessary shapes deleted from the file.</p>

                <h3>Coming in 2nd or 3rd </h3>
                <p>If your design comes in 2nd or 3rd place in a contest this does not mean you are going to be awarded a payment. Only if the client selects your design as a winner (regardless of coming in 2nd or 3rd place). The client can even choose more than one design to award prize payment to each winner. Furthermore, the client may even choose a winner(s) before the contest is scheduled to end, which closes the contest.</p>

                <h3>ALL logo designs Must contain high quality vectors</h3>
                <p>All parts within the logo design file Must be vector/shapes. All vectors/shapes must be editable and scalable. There should be no raster elements. All winning designs will be quality checked to ensure that the delivered files meet the client&apos;s (contest&apos;s) requirements and adhere to eSports Design Swarm rules.
                    Moreover :
                    All fonts should be converted to shapes
                    Closed shapes should not contain any breaks or gaps in the outline of your vector, no gaps or breaks between points in any vectors/shapes
                    Unnecessary shapes should be deleted
                    Submissions with vectors not possessing these attributes can/will be rejected.
                    Previews for all contests
                    Logo preview images should be 1000px x 1000px (300dpi) with a white back ground unless the design calls for a different color in back ground for the preview to work well. All other preview images should be .jpg format. All contests except for contests that involve video (motion) should be presented as .jpg format unless otherwise stated in the contest briefing. The resolution for each entry/submission Must be in the same resolution that the final design will be delivered in (although this is not a rule we will punish the designer for not following until it comes times for final file delivery), except for logo designs which are vector/scalable shapes and do not depend on resolution.
                    Example for submissions in a Twitter package contest : Twitter headers appear in best resolution at 1500x500 and profiles look best at 400x400 resolution; therefore, All entries to that contest Must appear in those resolutions. If the client  receives a final file that is not in the correct resolution the designer Must correct the issue or forfeit the prize money.</p>

                <h3>Not following rules</h3>
                <p>Failure to follow these rules can result in the elimination of your designs, temporary banning of your account, or even permanent banning from the website. We may also withhold or  cancel payments to you (any designer) if we believe your designs are in violation of eSports Design Swarm&apos;s standards. </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Property Rights and Our Rights</h3>
                <p>eSports Design Swarm Only claims the follow rights (Without such rights, we would not be able to host projects or maintain the marketplace. You’ll see similar language in the terms and conditions of service of other popular sites; for example, YouTube):</br><em>
                    a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform the content in connection with the Site, in any media known now or in the future.</em></p>

                <h3>Property Rights Guide Lines</h3>
                <p><em>The intellectual property (created by the designer) does not transfer to a client until the winning designer(s) is paid. Those designers whose work is not selected continue to own full rights to their work, and clients cannot simply modify the work of another person and use it – they acquire full rights Only to the work they’ve selected and Only after the designer(s) is paid. Once the designer has been paid All rights to that design(s) belongs to the client, even if the designer tries to with hold the delivery of the final design the Rights still belong to the client and the designer has agreed by accepting payment for the winning design that they agreed to All rights being passed onto the paying client. This prevents the designer from trying to re-sell or use the winning design(s) after the client has awarded the prize payment, and works to ensure that the final files will be delivered without delay.</em>
                    In contests that allow the designers to view other submissions , it is not uncommon for those designers to come up with similar ideas. Sometimes it can be a fine line between copying and original, here at esportsdesignswarm.com take care to respect each designers creativity and work to protect that creativity from intellectual property violations. If you have any questions please contact us.</p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Rules for Clients</h2>

                <p>Provide consistent and constructive feedback, and rate as many of the entries in your project as you can. This kind of interaction with the designers and contest(s) ensures that you will receive the best experience from your contest.
                    Select your winning design(s) within 5 days after your project ends, and close up any final issues without delay. However, the client can select a winner(s) at Any time after the contest has started and end the contest early. You may choose more than one winner and as soon as the contest ends (or even during the contest to end it early). If the client chooses more than one winner each design chosen as a winner will receive the Same prize payment.
                    The client may also rate the top 3 designs as 1st - 2nd - 3rd, which gives the designers that have not won, but came very close, another level of feedback and rating for their profile. Using the contest interface completely helps ensure you and the designers get the most out of esportsdesignswarm.com.
                    Once we see the contest has ended our quality assurance team will verify that the final delivered file(s) is/are in line with your contest briefing and follow our rules for submission and delivery of final designs.
                    We will NEVER allow any contest to be completed if there is a pending claim of non-compliance with our rules, final delivery of design file(s), and/or an intellectual property violation. After 5 days have passed and the client has not selected a winner (and the client has not asked for an extension regarding winner) esportsdesignswarm.com will automatically close the contest and refund the client.
                    Incomplete contest (contest that never have a winner chosen go against the paying client&apos;s profile and leave a permanent mark on their profile. The more you see a clients rating effected by incomplete contests the less likely the client will receive entries for their contest(s). We do this as a way to help inform our designers of sketchy clients. The same is done with designers ratings on their profiles, which enables the client to see the what kind of designer they may potentially work with or award their contest prize money.
                    All designers Must submit to the client if they are using any stock images or purchased images in their designs. If you suspect that a designer is breaking this rule please contact us right away.
                    No client is allowed to enter Any contest they have created or posted.
                    Never violate the intellectual property rights of another person and never ask someone else to. Everything on the site is owned by the person who originally created it until the designer has received their prize money.
                    Do not ask one designer to use an idea introduced by another designer.
                    Please be nice and respectful with all designers, they are working for FREE for you until the winner gets paid. If you find a designer breaking one of the rules then report that person to us, but do not confront the designer.
                    </br></br><strong>IMPORTANT: If you receive the final file from a designer and it is not in the right resolution or format please contact us right away. There is an issue when uploading images from phones (mobile devices) onto social networks, so if the (final design) picture looks blurred or resolution appears off there is a good chance it was uploaded by a mobile device. Please make sure to upload your winning designs via a laptop or desktop computer when using social networks (Twitter headers will appear in a bad resolution if you use a mobile device, like an iPhone, to upload).</strong></p>
